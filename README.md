# Kelvin-Celsius
If you are an astronomy enthusiast you very likely have encountered “Kelvins”. 
When you learn about a new exoplanet that temperature is written in those Kelvins, but 
most of us are not scientists and we can’t calculate this number to Celsius, so thanks to this
program you can type in Kelvins and it will say how many degrees it is in Celsius! 

(and the opposite).
